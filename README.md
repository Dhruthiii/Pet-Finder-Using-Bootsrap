Petfinder is a platform that connects potential pet adopters with animals in need of homes. By leveraging Bootstrap's responsive design and component library, the goal is to improve the overall user experience and accessibility of the website.

By using CSS and HTML I have designed with web application for finding the pet and to adapt them

Bootstrap provides a solid foundation for building a pet finder that is both functional and attractive to users.
